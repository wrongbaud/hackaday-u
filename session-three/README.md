# Session Three Exercises

These exercises are designed to illusrate the principals that are covered in the course materials, for session two we have the following exercises:

* structs
* pointers
* syscall
* files

**Note** You will need to mark these binaries as executable before trying to run them, ex: ```chmod u+x structs```

Each of these exercises are designed to accept user input from the command line - when the proper input is provided you will get a Success or Congratulatory message.

*Remember* you can provide non ascii input as follows:

```./pointers `python -c 'print "\xDE\xAD\xBE\xEF"'` ```

This example will provide the value 0xDEADBEEF into argv[1]


It is up to you to determine the format and number of these arguments for each exercise by reverse engineering them - if you get stuck please feel free to reach out on the [hackaday.io](https://hackaday.io/project/172292-introduction-to-reverse-engineering-with-ghidra) page, or reach out to me on [twitter](https://twitter.com/wrongbaud/).
